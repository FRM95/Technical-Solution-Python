#Creation of similar loop to facilitate concepts

        a += let

#First condition will be number of matches, if two rows got the same number of matches, we will sort them by proximity

#Aditional ways to implement this algorithm 

#Definitely the realization of this solution has not been an easy task, I modified on Saturday 28th the whole way of interpreting the algorithm, 
#because instead of sorting by number of matches and then by alphabetical order, 
#I had established a weighting system based on the non-zero position of each row, giving higher values for the leftmost positions.

#That is why a priori the statement seemed to me a bit ambiguous, and although it is true that applying my method the output obtained was 
#90% similar to the original one, it did not work correctly.

#I still think that the scoring system or weights for recommendations can be a great algorithm when it comes to establishing recommendation criteria. 
#It can be used both in a sentiment analysis of a product, giving high weights to positive ratings and words and negative ones to the opposite. 
#The improvement I would implement involves not only the referrer letter of each row, but also its value following the '-'. 
#Thus, a cell with value 'att-a1' would have a higher weight than one that was 'att-a123'. 

#The recommendation for both cases would be correct, since the column 'att-a' is similar to this value, 
#but the cell 'att-a1' would have more weight because it has a shorter string value or a string value closer to the original one.
